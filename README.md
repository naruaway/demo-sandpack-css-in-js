# demo-sandpack-css-in-js

My demo just to play with [Sandpack](https://github.com/codesandbox/sandpack).
Running Vite inside browser is fun.

For now I implemented editable demo to easily confirm the compilation result of Kuma UI using its own Vite plugin ([@kuma-ui/vite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kuma-ui/vite))

It's deployed at https://naruaway.github.io/demo-sandpack-css-in-js/
